# 📚 TDD Study Project

This project was developed as part of a study course on **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** at **Alura**.  
The goal is to learn and apply TDD principles by writing tests first and then implementing the code to pass those tests.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

- Practice writing automated tests before code implementation  
- Understand red-green-refactor cycle  
- Improve code quality and maintainability  
- Gain hands-on experience with unit testing frameworks

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Language: [Your chosen language, e.g., C#, Java, JavaScript]  
- Testing Framework: [e.g., xUnit, JUnit, NUnit, Jest]  
- Build Tools: [e.g., Maven, Gradle, dotnet CLI, npm]

## 🛠️ Key Concepts Covered

- Writing unit tests first  
- Mocking dependencies  
- Refactoring safely  
- Continuous testing and feedback

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Run the tests using the appropriate command or IDE integration  
3. Implement or modify code according to failing tests  
4. Repeat the TDD cycle

## 📌 Notes

This project is for learning purposes and to reinforce TDD practices through practical exercises.
