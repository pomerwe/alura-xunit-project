# 📚 TDD Study Project - .NET

This project was developed as part of a study course on **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** at **Alura**, using **.NET**.  
The goal is to practice TDD principles by writing tests first and then implementing code to make the tests pass.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

- Practice writing unit tests before code implementation  
- Follow the red-green-refactor cycle  
- Improve code quality, design, and maintainability  
- Gain hands-on experience with .NET testing frameworks

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- .NET (C#)  
- xUnit (or NUnit) for testing  
- Moq (optional) for mocking dependencies  
- dotnet CLI for build and test execution

## 🛠️ Key Concepts Covered

- Writing unit tests first  
- Mocking and stubbing dependencies  
- Safe refactoring after tests pass  
- Continuous testing workflow

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Navigate to the project folder  
3. Run tests using the command:  
   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```  
4. Implement or modify code guided by failing tests  
5. Repeat the TDD cycle

## 📌 Notes

This project is for educational purposes, focusing on mastering TDD techniques within the .NET environment.
